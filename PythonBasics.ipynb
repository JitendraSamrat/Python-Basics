        "1.what is python,and why its popular?\n",
        "  - Python is a high-level, easy-to-learn programming language known for its simplicity and versatility. It's used in web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and more. Python's extensive libraries, readability, and cross-platform support make it popular among beginners and professionals. Its active community, open-source nature, and wide application in major companies further contribute to its growth and popularity in the tech industry.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.what is an interpreter in python?\n",
        "  - An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line. It converts each line into intermediate code and runs it immediately, making Python easier to debug and test. The default Python interpreter is CPython, the most widely used implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What are pre-defined keywords in pythons?\n",
        "  - Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words with special meanings, used for defining control flow, data types, and functions. Examples include if, else, for, while, import, True, False, and return.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "  - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python because they are reserved for specific functions in the language. Using them will cause a syntax error. Examples include if, else, True, and while.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What is mutability in python?\n",
        "  - Mutability in Python refers to whether an object can be changed after it's created. Mutable objects like lists and dictionaries can be modified, while immutable objects like strings and tuples cannot. This concept helps manage data efficiently and prevents accidental changes to objects that should remain constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Why are the lists mutable,but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "  - Lists are mutable because they allow changes like adding, removing, or updating elements, making them flexible for dynamic data. Tuples are immutable to keep their data fixed and safe from changes. This makes tuples faster and useful when data must stay constant, such as keys in a dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What are the differences between \"==\" and \"is\" operators in Python?\n",
        "  - The == operator checks if the values of two objects are the same, while the is operator checks if both objects are the exact same instance in memory. == compares content, and is compares memory addresses, meaning == can return True even if two objects are different in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "  - Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditions. The three main operators are:\n",
        "   - and: Returns True if both conditions are true.\n",
        "   - or: Returns True if at least one condition is true.\n",
        "   - not: Reverses the result, returning True if the condition is false.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "  - Type casting in Python is the process of converting one data type into another. There are two types:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Implicit casting (automatic): Python automatically converts a lower\n",
        "      data type to a higher one (e.g., int to float).\n",
        "   - Explicit casting (manual): The programmer explicitly converts data\n",
        "      using functions like int(), float(), or str().\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What is the differences between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "  - Implicit type casting is done automatically by Python, converting smaller data types to larger ones (e.g., int to float). Explicit type casting requires the programmer to manually convert data using functions like int(), float(), or str(). Implicit casting happens without user intervention, while explicit casting is controlled by the programmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is the puropose of conditional statement in Python?\n",
        "  - Conditional statements in Python allow the program to make decisions based on conditions. They control the flow of execution by executing specific blocks of code if certain conditions are met. The main conditional statements are if, elif, and else, enabling the program to respond differently depending on input or logical tests.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "  - The elif (else if) statement in Python is used to check multiple conditions after an initial if statement. If the if condition is false, the elif condition is evaluated. If elif is true, its block of code executes. we can have multiple elif statements to check different conditions, followed by an optional else.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "  - A for loop iterates over a sequence (like a list or range), executing a fixed number of times. A while loop repeats as long as a specified condition is true, potentially running indefinitely. for is used for known iterations, while while is for dynamic conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "  - A while loop is more suitable when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a dynamic condition. For example, when waiting for user input or checking for a certain condition to be met, a while loop continues until the condition changes.\n",
